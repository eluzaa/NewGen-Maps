Data Flow and System Interaction
    1. The frontend sends requests to the backend through RESTful API calls.
    2. The backend processes requests, interacts with the database, and communicates with external APIs for real-time data.
    3. The backend stores and retrieves data from the database.
    4. The backend fetches map data, directions, and traffic updates from the mapping service. 5. The backend sends user data to the machine learning module for analysis and receives personalized route suggestions.
    6. All components are designed to work in a battery-efficient manner, with the frontend being able to toggle between normal and low-power modes.

Components and Their Interactions
    1. Frontend: Interacts with the backend through API calls and receives data to display to the user.
    2. Backend: Processes requests, interacts with the database, and communicates with external APIs.
    3. Database: Stores and retrieves data for the backend.
    4. Mapping APIs: Provides map data, directions, and traffic updates to the backend.
    5. Machine Learning Module: Analyzes user data and provides personalized route suggestions to the backend.
    6. Real-Time Updates Module: Manages live traffic updates and crowd density data.
    7. Offline Functionality: Provides AR-based navigation when offline.
    8. Battery Optimization Module: Reduces power consumption by minimizing API requests, data processing, and location updates.
    9. Emergency Route Module: Calculates the fastest route to emergency services with minimal data processing.
